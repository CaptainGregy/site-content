## Introduction

This repository holds the various content assets used on our Hugo-templated website, including articles, images, and other media. The purpose is to manage and version control all website content effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this repository, you will need:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (extended version recommended)
- A text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CaptainGregy/site-content.git
    ```
2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd site-content
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
    hugo mod get -u
    ```

4. Start the Hugo server:
